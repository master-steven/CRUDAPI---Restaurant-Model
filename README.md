# CRUDAPI---Restaurant-Model
Tentative WebComms Interface; v1 - Base CRUD + Abstract Data-Typed Transmits [GET...MESSAGE OK..ResponseBody 404, and etc...^_^]


The purpose of this Project is to showcase aspects of a Solution for a Restaurant that will assist in Operations by alleviating the process handling services of food order intake, handling, delivery, and quality assurance and satisfaction.
;
This, then, presupposes that the respective accompanying Helper Functions and Operations—data sanitization and validation, access control mechanisms along with the requirant safeguard protocols that would do the job of securing the Restaurant’s System from threat and risk—will follow.

It is my Hope and the Vision for this Project that, through the employment of this Asset, and the Restaurant’s utilization of this Solution, that the Organization at-hand will experience a 10X increase in productivity, throughput, and effective values created, thereby, effectively paying for itself, quickly returning on the customer’s Investment, and contributing to navigating it to farer, more richer and greener seas, and that, through its enriching Intelligence, will Inspire you to see the Possibilities That Lie Beyond—made Possible, with the use of JavaScript, Python, and the Representational State Transfer (REST) Framework-Architecture provided by the Django Ecosystem  ^_^
